		<h3 id="report">Reporting Wages</h3>
			<p>Wages must be reported each calendar quarter. <a title="title=Link to File and Pay Taxes and Fees - This link will open in a new window" 
			href="/taxes/eservices/Pages/filepay.aspx" target="_blank">Electronic filing of wage data</a> saves time and paperwork for most employers. An 
			<span style="font-style: italic;">Employer's Quarterly Report</span> (<a title="Link to Form RT-6 - This link will open in a new window" href="/Forms_library/current/rt6.pdf" 
			target="_blank">Form RT-6 <img alt="PDF Icon" src="/PublishingImages/pdficon_small.png"></a>) is mailed each quarter to employers who are not required to file 
			electronically. Employers who voluntarily file electronically for at least two consecutive quarters will not receive a paper RT-6.</p>
			
			<p>The report must list total wages paid to covered workers, excess wages, taxable wages, and tax due, and show each employee's name, social security number (SSN), and 
			total wages paid during the period. It is very important to ensure the employees' SSNs are correct. You can verify employees' social security numbers through the Federal 
			Government's <a title="Link to Social Security Number Verification Service - This link will open in a new window" href="https://www.ssa.gov/employer/ssnv.htm" 
			target="_blank">Social Security Number Verification Service</a>. Valid SSNs are needed to determine eligibility for reemployment assistance benefits and are also shared 
			with state and federal agencies, including Child Support, Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) 
			issued by the Internal Revenue Service is not a substitute.</p>
			
			<p>The penalty for filing an erroneous, incomplete, or insufficient report (which includes an inaccurate SSN) 
			with the Florida Department of Revenue is $50 or 10% of any tax due, whichever is greater, but no more than $300 per report. This penalty is waived if an accurate, 
			complete, and sufficient report is filed within 30 days after the penalty notice but may not be waived more than one time during a twelve-month period.</p>
			
			<p>Each employer must report only their own payroll, unless they are an employee leasing company or have been approved as a Common Paymaster. “Payrolling,” which is the 
			consolidation for tax purposes of payrolls by two or more, usually related, employers is not authorized by law. Each employer must earn their own experience rate based 
			on their individual employment experience.</p>
			
			<p>If an employer is operating two business units and the secondary unit(s) has a cumulative total of at least 10 employees, the employer should submit a Florida 
			Department of Economic Opportunity, <span style="font-style: italic;">Multiple Worksite Report</span>

			<h3 id="wages">Definition of Wages</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Wages are broadly defined as “all remuneration for employment” and include commissions, bonuses, back pay awards, and the cash value of all payments in any medium
				other than cash. Tips are wages if received while performing services that are considered employment and are included in a written statement furnished by the employee 
				to the employer. The Department may reclassify distributions as wages if an officer of a corporation performs services for the corporation and the officer reports zero 
				wages but receives a significant distribution. Unless the remuneration is specifically included in one of the exceptions listed below, the remuneration is considered 
				wages for purposes of Florida’s reemployment tax.</p>  
				
				<p>The following remuneration is excluded from the definition of wages:</p>

				<p>However, if the last day of the month is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the timely filing period is extended until the end of the next working day.</p>
				
				<p>If you are making your payment by electronic funds transfer (EFT) or Internet, you must initiate the payment by 5:00 p.m. ET on the business day prior to the 
				filing date(s) listed above for your payment to be considered timely. For a list of payment due dates, visit the Department's Forms and Publications web page and 
				select the current year <span style="font-style: italic;">Florida e-Services Calendar of Due Dates</span> (Form DR-659) under the

				<p>A late filing penalty is charged at $25 for each 30 days or fraction thereof that the report is delinquent. Florida law provides a floating rate of interest for late 
				payments of taxes and fees due. Interest rates, including daily rates, are published in Tax Information Publications that are updated on January 1 and July 1 each 
				year. An employer may request a waiver of part or all of any penalty and/or interest by calling the Department's Tax Information and Assistance line at 850-488-6800 or by filing a written request for waiver and establishing that imposition of penalty and/or interest would be inequitable.</p>
				
				<p>Examples of inequity include situations where the delinquency was caused by one of the following factors:</p>
				
					<ul style="padding-left: 22px;">
						<li>The required report was addressed or delivered to the wrong state or federal agency.</li>
						<li>Death or serious illness of the person responsible for the preparation and filing of the report.</li>
						<li>Destruction of the employer's business records by fire or other casualty.</li>
						<li>Unscheduled and unavoidable computer downtime.</li>
						<li>Erroneous information provided by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity or the Florida Department of Revenue (Department); failure of the 
						Department to furnish proper forms upon a timely request; or inability of the employer to obtain an interview with a representative of the Department. In each 
						case, a diligent attempt to obtain the necessary information or forms must have been made by the employer in sufficient time that prompt action by the 
						Department would have allowed the reports to be filed timely.</li>
					</ul>

				href="/taxes/taxesfees/Pages/tax_interest_rates.aspx" target="_blank">Tax and Interest Rates</a> web page.</p>
				
				<p>The Department will not consider a request for waiver of penalty until the employer has filed all reports due for the five years immediately preceding the request 
				for waiver.</p>

			<h3 id="install">Installment Payment Option</h3>
			<div>
				<p>Typically, the wage data and full payment of the quarterly tax are due by April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31 (of the following year). Employers may 
				make installment payments for the first three quarters. To qualify, the wage data and installment payment must be submitted on time. An employer who chooses to pay 
				in installments must pay an installment fee of $5.00 one time per calendar year, with the wage data for the quarter in which the election for installments is 
				made.</p>

			<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions About Installment Payment Option</h3>
			<div>
				<p><strong>Question:</strong> How does the installment payment option work?</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">Employers can choose to pay by installments for the first three quarters of each calendar year if they submit the 
				<span style="font-style: italic;">Employer's Quarterly Report</span> (<a title="Link to Form RT-6 - This link will open in a new window" 
				href="/Forms_library/current/rt6.pdf" target="_blank">Form RT-6 <img alt="PDF Icon" src="/PublishingImages/pdficon_small.png"></a>), either paper or electronic, 
				and payments on time and pay a $5 annual installment fee. Divide first quarter tax due into four equal payments, second quarter into three equal payments, and third 
				quarter into two equal payments. There is no installment option for the fourth quarter.</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">You can choose the installment option for any or all of the first three quarters. You are not required to fill out any extra 
				paperwork to pay by installments.</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">A law change in 2014 made the installment payment option permanent.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I participate in the installment option?</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">For the quarter in which you are first seeking to pay by installments, you must file your 
				<span style="font-style: italic;">Employer's Quarterly Report</span>, pay at least the minimum installment payment, and pay the $5 installment fee. You must submit 
				all three items <strong>on time</strong>.</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">You are required to pay the installment fee only one time per calendar year. In each of the following quarters, you must timely file 
				your <span style="font-style: italic;">Employer's Quarterly Report</span> and pay at least the minimum installment payment. The Department will provide paper filers 
				with coupons to use for installment payments.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is the $5 installment fee due only when the first installment payment is paid for the year, even though it might be for the second 
				quarter report?</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">Yes. The $5 installment fee is due in the quarter when the employer first participates in the installment plan for the year. This $5 
				fee is due only one time per calendar year.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Question:</strong> How will the amount due for installment payments be determined?</p>

				<p style="padding-left: 22px;"><strong>Quarter ending March 31:</strong> Four equal payments. Tax Due on Line 5 <span style="font-style: italic;">(Employer's 
				Quarterly Report)</span> divided by 4 will give you the installment payment amounts. For the first quarter you are electing to pay installments, you must include 
				the $5 fee on line 8.</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;"><strong>Quarter ending June 30:</strong> Three equal payments. Tax Due on Line 5 <span style="font-style: italic;">(Employer's 
				Quarterly Report)</span> divided by 3 will give you the installment payment amounts.</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;"><strong>Quarter ending September 30:</strong> Two equal payments. Tax Due on Line 5 <span style="font-style: italic;">(Employer's 
				Quarterly Report)</span> divided by 2 will give you the installment payment amounts.</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">You can use the <a title="Link to Reemployment Tax Installment Option Calculation Website - This link will open in a new window"

				<p><strong>Question:</strong> Will I be notified if I am approved to pay by installments?</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">Yes, if you submitted the $5 installment fee and the minimum amount due, you will receive a notice from the Department confirming 
				your placement into the plan. The notice will include a payment schedule and, if you file paper reports, installment coupons. If, however, you fail to include 
				the required fee or the minimum amount due, you will be notified that you were not placed into the plan and that full payment is due immediately.</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">Electronic filers will not receive installment coupons. The Department offers an electronic 
				<a title="Link to Sign up to Receive Due Date Reminders - This link will open in a new window" href="/Pages/subscribe.aspx" target="_blank">due date 
				reminder service</a> to help you file on time. Paper filers can also subscribe to this service.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there an approval process for the installment option?</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">There is no formal approval process. For the first quarter you want to pay in installments, you must file your reemployment tax 
				report on time along with the minimum installment payment and the $5 installment fee.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Question:</strong> Once installment payments have been set up for my account, do I have to pay by installments for the rest of the calendar year?</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">No. Each return and payment for a quarter stands on its own. Employers may pay the remaining installment payments earlier than the actual due 
				dates. Employers may participate in the installment plan for one quarter, but pay the tax in full for other quarters.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Question:</strong> When the installments overlap (for example: on December 31, payments are due for the first, second and third quarters), can I send a 
				lump sum for the total amount due?</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">Yes. Paper filers should submit one payment for the final installments for all quarters using the coupon provided by the Department. 
				E-filers should follow the instructions on the website.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can I participate in the installment plan if I submit my RT-6 late?</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">No. You must file the <span style="font-style: italic;">Employer's Quarterly Report</span> 
				(<a title="Link to Form RT-6 - This link will open in a new window" href="/Forms_library/current/rt6.pdf" target="_blank">Form RT-6 
				<img alt="PDF Icon" src="/PublishingImages/pdficon_small.png"></a>) and pay the first installment and the $5 fee on time. If you file the first quarter report late, 
				you will not be eligible for the installment plan for that quarter. However, you may choose the installment payment plan for later quarters if the reports are filed 
				on time.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Question:</strong> Will I be charged interest for paying by installments?</p>
				
				<p style="padding-left: 22px;">No, as long as you pay the annual $5 fee and submit your <span style="font-style: italic;">Employer's Quarterly Report</span> and the 
				minimum installment amount on time each quarter.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h3 id="correct">Correcting Errors</h3>
			<div>
				<p>To correct a previously filed quarterly report, an employer can submit the corrections online using the Department's 
				<a title="Link to File and Pay - This link will open in a new window" href="/taxes/eservices/Pages/filepay.aspx" 
				target="_blank">File and Pay</a> web page.</p>

				<p>After the employer logs in to the Reemployment Tax website, there will be a new option to correct a previously submitted report (RT-6). If the corrections are made 
				online, the employer will receive a printable confirmation after completing the submission. For more information about this new process, please see the informative 
				<a title="Link to Electronic Form RT-8 Guide - This link will open in a new window" href="/taxes/Documents/flRt8aUserGuide.pdf" target="_blank">Electronic RT-8A 
				Guide</a>.</p>
				
				<p>Reasons for correcting a previously filed quarterly report include:</p>
					<ul style="padding-left: 22px;">
						<li>Adding or decreasing wages</li>
						<li>Adding or deleting workers</li>
						<li>Correcting social security numbers (All quarters for the calendar year for which the worker had wages must be corrected, if applicable)</li>
						<li>Correcting out-of-state wages</li>
						<li>Correcting educational wages</li>
						<li>Responding to the following correspondence sent by the Department:</li>
							<ul>
								<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Incomplete or Incorrect Report Notice</span> (Form RT-FL04A)</li>
								<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Incomplete Quarterly Report Notice</span> (Form RT-FL06A)</li>
								<li><span style="font-style: italic;">Missing Wage Report Notice</span> (Form RT-FL13A)</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				
				<p>The corrections may also be submitted by mailing a paper <span style="font-style: italic;">Correction to Employer's Quarterly or Annual Domestic Report</span> 
				(<a title="Correction to Employer's Quarterly or Annual Domestic Report" href="/Forms_library/current/rt8a.pdf" target="_blank">Form RT-8A 
				 <img alt="PDF Icon" src="/PublishingImages/pdficon_small.png"></a>) to the Department.The Department can require the employer to file a corrected report as far back 
				 as 5 years. If the employer did not previously file a report, the error would need to be corrected by submitting the quarterly wage data electronically or completing 
				 an <span style="font-style: italic;">Employer's Quarterly Report</span> 
				 (<a title="Link to Form RT-6 - This link will open in a new window" href="/Forms_library/current/rt6.pdf" target="_blank">Form RT-6

				 any interest due.</p>
