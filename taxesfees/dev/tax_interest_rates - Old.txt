  <h2>Florida Tax and Interest Rates</h2>
  <div>
		<p>The <strong>Interest Rates</strong> section identifies interest rates for the late payment of tax, and includes instructions on how to calculate interest due. 
		This section applies to all tax types.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Tax Rates</strong> vary depending on the tax so, unlike the interest rates, tax rates are separated and listed by tax type. The list below includes the most 
		common taxes the Florida Department of Revenue administers. For more information on a specific tax, see the Department's <a title="Link to Taxes and Fees or Refunds" 
		href="/taxes/taxesfees/Pages/default.aspx">Taxes and Fees or Refunds</a> web page.</p>

   <h3 id="interest">Interest Rates</h3>
   <div>
	 
     <p>Interest is assessed on the amount of taxes or fees due that was not paid on time. This includes late or underpayments of taxes or fees, and collection allowances 
		 (credits) that have been reduced due to underpayments of tax or disallowed because the return was filed late. A floating rate of interest applies. Florida&#39;s interest 
		 rate is updated twice a year, on January 1 and July 1. Current and past year&#39;s interest rates are published in <a title="Link to Tax Information Publications" 
		 target="_blank" href="/taxes/tips/Pages/default.aspx">Tax Information Publications (TIPs)</a>.</p>

     <p>To calculate interest due with your tax return:</p>
		 
     <ol style="padding-left: 22px;">
      <li>Get the daily interest rate factor(s) for the filing period(s) from the appropriate Tax Information Publication. </li>
      <li>Calculate the number of days your return is late by counting the number of days from the “late after” date on the return through the date the return and payment are 
			postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service or hand-delivered to the Florida Department of Revenue. Include the day the return and payment are postmarked or 
			hand-delivered when calculating the number of days late.</li>
      <li>Multiply the amount of tax due by the number of days late and then by the appropriate daily interest rate factor(s).</li>
     </ol>
     <p> 
      <strong>Example 1:</strong> A taxpayer owed $1,000 with his November 2013 Florida sales and use tax return (due 12/20/13). The taxpayer filed the return and paid the tax due on 
March 10, 2014. The return and payment are 80 days late and the daily interest rate for December 2013 to March 2014 was used. The interest amount due is computed as follows:</p>

      <strong>Example 2:</strong> A taxpayer owed $5,000 with their September 2009 Florida sales and use tax return (due 10/20/09). The taxpayer filed the return and paid the tax 
			on February 10, 2010. The return and payment are 113 days late. Two different daily interest rate factors must be used in the calculation because the interest rate changed on 
			January 1, 2010. For the period 10/20/09 to 12/31/09 the daily interest rate is .000219178 and for the period 1/1/10 to 2/10/10 the daily interest rate is .000191781. The

		<p>When a new employer becomes liable for the tax, the rate is 2.7% (.0270) and remains at that rate until the employer has reported for 10 quarters (11 quarters 
		in some cases). At that time, a tax rate will be calculated using the employment record and the rating factors, which are built into the Reemployment Assistance Program Law. 
		Rate notices are mailed to all contributing employers each year in December. An employer may appeal the tax rate within 20 days from the date of notification 
		(date printed on the Reemployment Tax Rate Notice (Form RT-20). The maximum tax rate allowed by law is 5.4% (.0540), except for employers participating in the Short 
		Time Compensation Program. Visit the Department's <a title="Link to Reemployment Tax Page - This will open in a new window" target="_blank" href="/taxes/taxesfees/Pages/reemployment.aspx">Reemployment Tax</a> web page for more information.</p>

     <h3>Sales and Use Tax and Discretionary Sales Surtax Rates</h3>
     
		<p>Florida&#39;s general sales and use tax rate is 6%; however, other rates may apply based on the type of sale (e.g., 4% on amusement machine receipts and 6.95% on 
		electricity). Discretionary sales surtax (also called county tax) is imposed by many Florida counties and applies to most transactions subject to sales tax. The Florida 
		Department of Revenue collects both taxes and distributes the surtax back to the counties. The discretionary sales surtax rate depends on the county. To 
		compute the sales tax rate for each county, add the local option surtax rate to the general sales tax rate. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Discretionary Sales 
		Surtax Information</span> (<a title="Link to Form DR-15DSS - This will open in a new window" target="_blank" href="/Pages/forms_index.aspx#discretionary">Form DR-15DSS)</a> lists the counties and their rates.

of Local and Current Sales Tax Rates <img alt="PDF Icon" src="/PublishingImages/pdficon_small.png"/></a> lists the counties and their historical local tax rates.</p>
		
		<p>When sales transactions fall below or in between whole dollar amounts, you must use the bracket system to calculate the tax between whole dollar amounts. Under the 
		bracket system, the actual tax collected may be more than a straight percentage of the total sales made during the reporting period. <p>The
