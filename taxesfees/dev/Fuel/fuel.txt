	<h2>Florida ​Fuel Tax​​​​​</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The Florida Department of Revenue is responsible for administering fuel taxes for the state of Florida. For purposes of tax administration, fuel is defined as motor, 
		diesel, aviation, or natural gas fuel.</p>
		
			<ul style="padding-left: 22px;">
				<li><strong>Motor Fuel or Fuel:</strong> All gasoline products or any product blended with gasoline or any fuel placed in the storage supply tank of a 
				gasoline-powered motor vehicle.</li>
				<li><strong>Diesel Fuel:</strong> All petroleum distillates commonly known as diesel #2, biodiesel, or any other product blended with diesel or any product placed 
				into the storage supply tank of a diesel-powered motor vehicle.</li>
				<li><strong>Aviation Fuel:</strong> Fuel for use in aircraft, including aviation gasoline and aviation turbine fuels and kerosene, as determined by the American 
				Society for Testing Materials specifications D-910 or D-1655, or current specifications.</li>
				<li><strong>Natural Gas Fuel:</strong> Any liquefied petroleum gas product, compressed natural gas product, or combination thereof used in a motor vehicle as defined 
				in Section 206.01(23), Florida Statutes (F.S.). This term includes, but is not limited to, all forms of fuel commonly or commercially known or sold as natural 
				gasoline, butane gas, propane gas, or any other form of liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, or liquefied natural gas. This term does not include natural 
				gas or liquefied petroleum placed in a separate tank of a motor vehicle for cooking, heating, water heating, or electric generation.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p>Fuel tax is imposed on the ultimate consumer, but pre-collected for administrative convenience. The tax rates assessed on fuel are adjusted each year and are valid from 
		January 1 to December 31. Fuel tax is due each month and includes the inspection fee, state tax, local option tax, and pollutants tax. The administration of fuel tax is 
		found in Chapters 206 and 336, F.S., and in Rule Chapter 12B-5, Florida Administrative Code.</p>
		
		<p>A person must have one or more of the following licenses to store, import, export, carry, blend, apply for a refund, or sell fuel in Florida. The method of operation 
		determines the type of fuel license(s):​​</p>

			<div>
				<p>To apply for a fuel or pollutants license, you must submit a completed <span style="font-style: italic;">Registration Package for Motor Fuel 
				and/or Pollutants Registrants</span> (<a title="Link to Form GT400401 - This link will open in a new window" 
				href="/Forms_library/current/gt400401.pdf" target="_blank">Form GT-400401</a>), undergo a background check, pay applicable fees, and post a bond.</p>

				<p>You must pay a $30 fee for each license classification (except local government users, mass transit system providers, and natural gas retailers). Each license 
				(except local government users and mass transit system providers) must be renewed annually by filing the <span style="font-style: italic;">Renewal Application 
				for Florida/Pollutant Fuel Licenses</span> (Form DR-156R) and paying the appropriate license fee. A personalized renewal application is automatically sent to 
				registered licensees.</p>

				<ul style="padding-left: 22px;">
					<li>change your business name;</li>

				may be submitted if you own more than one retail station and each station operates under a single Federal Employee Identification Number. However, you must provide a 
				separate attachment that lists the station name, physical location, and sales tax number for each retail station. Form DR-156 is included in the 
				<span style="font-style: italic;">Registration Package for Motor Fuel and/or Pollutants Registrants</span>

				transit system providers, and air carriers are not required to undergo a background check. </p>
