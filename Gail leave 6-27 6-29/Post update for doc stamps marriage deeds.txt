Robert,
 
Per your request you submitted a while ago, I've added the information for marriage deeds to the doc stamps web page "Examples of Documents Generally Not Subject to Tax" accordion: https://dorspqasint.fdor.dor.state.fl.us/taxes/taxesfees/Pages/doc_stamp.aspx.
 
What you had written was confusing to me, so I had Renee review it. She read it as three items, so I made a list for it. Let me know if this is incorrect. I just noticed I need to add the reference you have listed.
 
I'm including Shea to have him in the loop due to me being on leave June 27-29, so he will need to submit the request to OC and ISP.
 
Thanks! Gail
