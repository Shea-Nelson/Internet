				Enrollment</a> web page, then selecting the "Update e-Enrollment" option. The tax collector will be prompted to enter an user ID and password to log in. Once logged 
				in, the filing and/or payment method should be changed to "Internet file and pay." For counties with multiple office locations, the process must be repeated for each 
				user ID and password.</p>
